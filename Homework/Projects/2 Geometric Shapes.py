Project 2

Any picture can be decomposed into a set of geometric objects, points lines and shapes.  This is true of everything
scenes that depict people, for example, or mosaics that are purely geometric.

Your project is to write a program that draws a picture of some kind using lines, shapes and basic colors. It should
repeat, in some arrangement, at least 5 basic shapes, and use at least 3 colors. You can imitate known patterns, copy
part of a picture you like, or create an original scene.

# for my picture I will be recreating the back wall of my living room. It consists of a TV and sound bar atop a stand
# with slide out boxes.
# I've included a photo of the scene as livingroom.pdf for reference
# 5+ shapes are as follows: TV, sound bar, box shelf (with 4 colored boxes), and coffee table


# create graphic screen to draw in
screen = GraphWin("Living Room", 1000, 600)
screen.setBackground("tan")

# create objects for each shape (loop where possible)

# draw each object

# color each shape accordingly
