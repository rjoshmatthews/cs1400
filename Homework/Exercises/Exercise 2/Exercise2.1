#  1. Chapter 2, Discussion #1, pg. 53. List in your own words the
    six steps in the software development process:

1 - Explore the problem. Understand each aspect of the problem to develop a rounded idea of how to solve it

2 - Determine solution. Focus on "what" the program will do to solve the program. Don't hash out the "how", but focus
    on the "what"

3 - Create the structure of the program. Organize "how" your program will accomplish the solution

4 - Transfer your design into a computer language--convert your algorithms into programs

5 - Murphy's Law: "whatever can go wrong, will go wrong." Thoroughly test and debug your program to streamline
    the process and assure function

6 - Develop the program according to the needs of your users. Programs are never complete--they evolve
