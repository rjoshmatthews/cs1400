3. Chapter 2, Discussion #5, pg. 53. Why is it a good idea to first write out an algorithm in pseudocode before jumping
    immediately into Python code?


        Writing out a "short hand" version of your planned code helps you follow your logical structure without worrying
        about the format your code actually needs to be in. Once you have written the entire program in pseudo code you
        can then easily turn your pseudo code into comments to help you write and structure your algorithms.
