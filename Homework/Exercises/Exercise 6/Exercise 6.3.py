3. How are formal and actual parameters matched up when a function is called?
"""

# from the book, pg. 184, it gives a 4 step process for matching formal and actual parameters:
#
# 1. the calling program suspends execution at the point of the call
# 2. the formal parameters of the function get assigned the values supplied by the actual parameters in the call
# 3. the body of the function is executed
# 4. control returns to the point just after where the function was called
