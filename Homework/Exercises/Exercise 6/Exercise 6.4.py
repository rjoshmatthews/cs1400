4. Chapter 6, Discussion #1, pg 204. In your own words, give two reasons for defining functions in your programs.
"""

# the first reason I would use a function would be to eliminate duplication in my code... The less I have to
# copy/paste, or type it again, the better! the second reason I would use a function is to build a more
# complicated/sophisticated program using simpler code. This would help eliminate the chance of bugs and would make it
# easier to read if someone else had to use the code I had written
