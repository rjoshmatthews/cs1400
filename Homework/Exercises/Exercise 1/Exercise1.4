4. Give a 1-sentence definition for each of the following terms.
   If looking up definitions on the Internet, make sure you use the Computer Science definitions.

intractable:
    """A problem that can be solved in theory (e.g. given large but finite resources, especially time),
    but for which in practice any solution takes too many resources to be useful, is known as an intractable problem.
    Conversely, a problem that can be solved in practice is called a tractable problem, literally "a problem that can
    be handled". The term infeasible (literally "cannot be done") is sometimes used interchangeably with intractable,
    though this risks confusion with a feasible solution in mathematical optimization"""
    (see Wikipedia--"Computational Complexity Theory")

algorithm:
    a defined procedure that allows a computer to solve a problem

compiler:
    a program that converts instructions into a machine-code or lower-level form so that they can be read and executed
    by a computer

interpreter:
    a program that can analyze and execute a program line by line

high-level language:
    a programming language that enables a programmer to write programs that are more or less independent of a particular
    type of computer
