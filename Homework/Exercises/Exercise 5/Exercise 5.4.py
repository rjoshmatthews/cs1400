Chapter 5, Discussion #1, pg. 171. Explain briefly why public key encryption is more useful for securing communication
on the Internet than private (shared) key encryption.

# If we used private key encryption then all online transactions would become insecure. Most of the way I manage my
# income requires some form of online encryption. Even my paycheck is deposited via online access! If I only had the
# shared key system then everyone that I did business with would have access to my info and everyone they did business
# with would also have my information. Glad we use a secure system!
