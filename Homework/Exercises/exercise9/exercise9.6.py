Chapter 9, Programming Exercises #11, pg 309.  What is the probability of rolling five of a kind in a single roll of
five 6-sided dice? For this problem, submit pseudo code only, not Python, but don't leave out any steps.

# this program will calculate the probability of rolling x of a kind in various rolls of various sided dice
# determine the number of dice to be rolled = dice
# determine the sides of the dice being used = sides
# determine how many times you will roll a certain amount of dice = roll
# determine how many of a kind you are trying to roll = kind
# calculate this expression: roll * caclulated_roll
# caclulated_roll = 1 / (sides ** dice)
# print the odds of getting (kind) of a kind are (calculated_roll) or 1 out of (sides ** dice)
